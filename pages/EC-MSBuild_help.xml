        <!-- The tool description should answer these kinds of questions:
        What is the tool itself is used for in the development
        process? Who would use this tool? What is the general use-case or
        problem that this tool solves? Look at the tool's documentation or
        website(s) to get their own descriptions. Look at Wikipedia or other
        outside websites. If there is a Hudson plugin, read their
        documentation for ideas, examples, etc. It's OK to copy word-for-word
        only if appropriate, such as FOSS - but not commercial software.

		<p>Revised on May 23, 2019</p>
		
        <p>MSBuild is a Microsoft build platform typically used in
        conjunction with Visual Studio. MSBuild version 2.0 is part
        of .NET Framework 2.0 and works together with Visual Studio
        2005. Version 3.5 of MSBuild, which is bundled together
        with .NET 3.5 (and Visual Studio 2008), allows .NET
        projects to be built for either 2.0, 3.0 or 3.5 .NET
        version support (also known as"multi-targeting").</p>

        <p>It is possible to build Visual Studio projects and
        solutions without the Visual Studio IDE installed. MSBuild
        is available at no cost.</p>

        <p>MSBuild acts on MSBuild project files which have a
        similar XML syntax to Apache Ant or NAnt. Even though the
        syntax is based upon well-defined XML schema, the
        fundamental structure and operation is comparable to the
        traditional Unix make utility: the user specifies what will
        be used (typically source code files) and what the result
        should be (typically an application), but the utility
        itself decides what to do and the order in which to do
        it..</p>

        <h2>MSBuild Links</h2>

        <p>More information can be found at
        <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms164311.aspx">

        <h2>CloudBees Flow Integration to MSBuild</h2>
        <!-- The integration description should answer the questions:
        How deep does our integration go? Why should I care? What general
        functionality does the plugin include? What functionality does
        the plugin omit?
        -->

        <p>@PLUGIN_KEY@ plugin calls the MSBuild tool via command
        line and passes the user-provided parameters.</p>

        <p>@PLUGIN_KEY@ plugin includes the most important features
        provided by the MSBuild tool, also allows some extra
        funcionality to make the test more configurable according
        to specific needs.</p>

        <p>CloudBees Flow itself provides some advantages like
        parameters checking, easy functionality selection using
        only check boxes or radio buttons, hitorical log reports,
        procedure duration statistics, simple credentials
        attachment, real time analysis of the log been generated,
        among others.</p>

        <h2>Integrated Version</h2>

        <p>This plugin was developed and tested against version
        present on Visual Studio 2005 and 2008.</p>

        <h1>Plugin Procedures</h1>

        <p>IMPORTANT: For all parameter descriptions below,
        required parameters are shown in
        <span class='required'>bold italics</span>.</p>

        <div id="runMSBuild">
            <a name='runMSBuild'
                 id="runMSBuild"></a> 

            <h3>Run MSBuild</h3>

            <p>This procedure allows the input of all necessary
            parameters along with some extra of them to make the
            test more configurable. When the parameters are defined
            the MSBuild command is created and run into the
            Commander, displaying at the end the result(s) of it.
            It displays a summary of the Build Warnings and Build
            Errors. It also creates a online log file, which
            contains the output generated by the console.</p>

            <p>There are dependent fields, which are 'Property
            Name' and 'Property Value' because the value must
            correspond with ther given property name, otherwise it
            will not work. This is the command-line '/p:Property
            Name=Property Value' option.The available properties
            can be found here:
            <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb629394.aspx">
            MSBuild Properties</a></p>

            <p>When using the logger(s) option only the name of the
            file and its extension must be provided.</p>
